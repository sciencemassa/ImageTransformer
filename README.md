# ImageTransformer
This is the code I created to transform figures pulled from outside sources so that they match the theme of the presentation I made.
It's really simple to use:
Just set the file path to the image you want to start with, then
Set the range to a couple values above and a couple values below your target RGB value
Then select the RGB value you wish to change them to
And finally, name your file
Click run and you will get a transformed image.
